# Security Best Practices

## Environment Variables and API Keys

### Production Environment

1. **Never expose sensitive API keys in client-side code**
   - All API keys should be stored as environment variables on the server
   - Use Vercel Secrets or similar for storing sensitive values
   - Reference secrets using the `@secret-name` syntax in vercel.json

2. **Use server-side API endpoints**
   - Create server-side API endpoints to proxy requests to third-party services
   - Never make direct API calls with sensitive keys from the browser

3. **Set up proper Content Security Policy (CSP)**
   - Restrict which domains can load resources on your site
   - Prevent XSS attacks by limiting inline scripts

### Development Environment

1. **Use .env.local for local development**
   - Never commit .env files to version control
   - Use .env.example as a template with placeholder values

2. **Validate environment variables**
   - Check for required variables at startup
   - Provide helpful error messages when variables are missing

## API Security

1. **Rate limiting**
   - Implement rate limiting on all API endpoints
   - Prevent abuse and excessive usage

2. **Input validation**
   - Validate all user input on the server side
   - Use TypeScript types and validation libraries

3. **Authentication and authorization**
   - Implement proper authentication for all API endpoints
   - Use Firebase Authentication for user management
   - Set up proper Firestore security rules

## Firebase Security

1. **Firestore Security Rules**
   - Implement strict security rules for all collections
   - Test rules thoroughly before deployment
   - Use the principle of least privilege

2. **API Key Restrictions**
   - Restrict Firebase API keys to specific domains
   - Set up proper Firebase Authentication methods

## OpenAI API Security

1. **Server-side implementation**
   - Never expose OpenAI API keys in client-side code
   - Create server-side API endpoints to proxy requests to OpenAI
   - Implement rate limiting and usage tracking

2. **Content filtering**
   - Validate user input before sending to OpenAI
   - Implement content moderation for responses

## Integration Security

1. **OAuth best practices**
   - Use proper OAuth flows for all integrations
   - Store refresh tokens securely
   - Implement token rotation

2. **Webhook security**
   - Validate webhook signatures
   - Implement proper error handling

## Deployment Security

1. **CI/CD security**
   - Use GitHub Actions secrets for sensitive values
   - Implement security scanning in CI/CD pipeline

2. **Regular updates**
   - Keep all dependencies up to date
   - Regularly audit dependencies for vulnerabilities

## Monitoring and Logging

1. **Security logging**
   - Log security-relevant events
   - Implement proper error handling

2. **Monitoring**
   - Set up monitoring for suspicious activity
   - Implement alerts for security events
